Welcome to the our first tutorial on Making a Game with Phaser. Here we will learn how to create a small game involving a player running and jumping around platforms collecting stars. While going through this process we'll explain some of the core features of the framework.

<h3>What is Phaser?</h3>

<a href="http://phaser.io">Phaser</a> is an HTML5 game framework 
<!-- which aims to help developers make powerful, cross-browser HTML5 games really quickly and, unlike some others, has solely been built to work with the mobile browsers. The only browser requirement is the support of the canvas tag. It also borrows a lot from Flixel. -->

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
	<li>You need to have a very, very basic knowledge of JavaScript.</li>
	<!-- <li>Also make sure you go through the <a href="http://phaser.io/getting-started-js.php">Getting Started Guide</a>, it will show you how to download the framework, set up a local development environment, and give you a glimpse of the structure of a Phaser project and its core functions.</li> -->
</ul>

Download the resources for this tutorial from here and unzip it on your mac.

Open the tutorial.html page in your editor of choice and let's have a closer look at the code. After a little boilerplate HTML that includes Phaser the code structure looks like this:
 
<pre class="lang:js decode:true " >
var game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, '', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update });

function preload() {
}

function create() {
}

function update() {
}
</pre> 

Line 1 is where you bring Phaser to life by creating an object and assigning it to a variable called 'game'. 

The first two parameters are the width and the height of the canvas element that Phaser will create. In this case 800 x 600 pixels. 

The fourth parameter is an empty string. The final parameter is an object containing four references to Phasers essential functions. Don't worry about this yet.

<h3>Load Assets</h3>

Let's load the assets we need for our game. You do this by putting calls to game.load inside of a function called preload. Phaser will automatically look for this function when it starts and load anything defined within it.

Currently the preload function is empty. Change it to:
 
<pre class="lang:js decode:true " >function preload() {

    game.load.image('sky', 'assets/sky.png');
    <!-- game.load.image('ground', 'assets/platform.png');
    game.load.image('star', 'assets/star.png'); -->
    game.load.spritesheet('dude', 'assets/dude.png', 32, 48);

}
</pre> 

Based off of this example load the ground & star assets.

At this point 4 assets: 3 images and a sprite sheet should be loaded. I would like to point out the first parameter, also known as the asset key. This string is a link to the loaded asset and is what you'll use in your code when creating sprites. You're free to use any valid JavaScript string as the key.

<h3>Create a Sprite</h3>

In order to add a sprite to our game place the following code in the create function:

<pre class="lang:js decode:true ">game.add.sprite(0, 0, 'star');</pre>

If you bring up the page in a browser you should now see a black game screen with a single star sprite in the top left corner:

<img src="http://www.photonstorm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/part3.png" alt="part3" width="800" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13605" />

The order in which items are rendered in the display matches the order in which you create them. So if you wish to place a background behind the star sprite you would need to ensure that it was added as a sprite first, before the star.

<h3>World Building</h3> 

game.add.sprite is creating a new sprite object and adding the sprite to the game world. This world is where all your objects live.

For convenience Phaser places 0,0 at the top left of your game for you.

The world class can be accessed via game.world and comes with a lot of handy methods and properties to help you distribute your objects inside the world. It includes some simple properties like game.world.height, but also some more advanced ones that we will use in another tutorial.

For now let's build up the scene by adding a background and platforms. Here is the updated create function:
 
<pre class="lang:js decode:true " >var platforms;

function create() {

    //  We're going to be using physics, so enable the Arcade Physics system
    game.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);

    //  A simple background for our game
    game.add.sprite(0, 0, 'sky');

    //  The platforms group contains the ground and the 2 ledges we can jump on
    platforms = game.add.group();

    //  We will enable physics for any object that is created in this group
    platforms.enableBody = true;

    // Here we create the ground.
    var ground = platforms.create(0, game.world.height - 64, 'ground');

    //  Scale it to fit the width of the game (the original sprite is 400x32 in size)
    ground.scale.setTo(2, 2);

    //  This stops it from falling away when you jump on it
    ground.body.immovable = true;

    //  Now let's create two ledges
    var ledge = platforms.create(400, 400, 'ground');

    ledge.body.immovable = true;

    ledge = platforms.create(-150, 250, 'ground');

    ledge.body.immovable = true;
    
}
</pre> 

Before moving on spend about 15 minutes commenting out lines and replacing numbers. Try to understand what each line is doing.
